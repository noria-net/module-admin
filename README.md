# Noria Chain Boilerplate

## Overview

This is a cosmos-sdk chain boilerplate for creating custom modules. It is a fork from [CosmWasm/wasmd](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd) that has been upgraded to be compatible with [ignite](https://github.com/ignite/cli).

## Wasm

The boilerplate is compatible with the CosmWasm smart contracts. Wasmd sync'd commit: [fc45b6d53136b20e0fb77643f2314d7f3d108e11](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/commit/fc45b6d53136b20e0fb77643f2314d7f3d108e11).
